/*
NOTE: early development only...

Time workcode invoice line generation.  Uses the VAT2/ACN No field in financial tab of
name record to determine format.
'D' gives detailed format each entry has a line: date person time_spent time_comment
Any other value gives paragraph of time_comment

BUT HELP NEEDED! this works in sql with explicit name_id and invoice_id, but crashes Patricia
when these are replaced by the %NI and %IN respectively.  Working on this - thoughts welcome.

Once working in Patricia, I will add further IF_THEN to use default time_comment when
comment field empty.
